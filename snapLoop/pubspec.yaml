publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
    # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
    # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
    # the material Icons class.
    uses-material-design: true
    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - assets/images/
        - assets/memojis/
        - packages/timezone/data/2020a.tzf

    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: Open Sans
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-italic.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf
                style: italic
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
                weight: 500
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-ExtraBold.ttf
                weight: 900
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
                weight: 300
              - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Light.ttf
                weight: 100
